## Sending Emails from Taguchi®

Emails sent from Taguchi usually originate from one of the following two sources:

1. They are HTML emails created externally (i.e. outside of the Taguchi system) and uploaded into a Taguchi ‘blank template’ via the Activity Edit interface or;
2. They are assembled and edited within Taguchi using an existing Taguchi email template, also within the Activity Edit interface. These templates can be created in Taguchi by developers and designers familiar with JavaScript, HTML and XML.

Either of the above methods are perfectly acceptable to be used within Taguchi. Many organizations use a combination of the two, depending on their communication requirements.

## Email Templates (HTML v Taguchi)

Generally speaking, an ‘email template’ is a term often used to describe an HTML document created specifically for the purposes of an email broadcast. This ‘HTML Template’ is usually designed in a way that can be copied and edited to broadcast similar looking emails with fresh content over and over again. 

The overall design of the email remains relatively consistent each time it is used in a broadcast, and usually someone familiar with HTML incorporates new content and makes any minor design tweaks as required.

HTML emails need to be tested across multiple email clients (e.g. Outlook, Gmail, Hotmail) to ensure they render consistently. As more changes are made to the HTML template, the likelihood that the HTML will need to be re-tested is increased.

A Taguchi template is far more sophisticated than a standard HTML email template, as outlined below.

## Why would I use a Taguchi template?

Unlike a standard HTML email document, a Taguchi template produces an HTML email but keeps the email content separate from the email’s presentation layer during the email production process. This allows the same content to be presented in a variety of ways without changing the code of the template itself.

A properly scoped, designed and built Taguchi template will:

* Allow significant email design and presentation flexibility while ensuring consistency of important corporate brand elements;
* Increase productivity through decreased production time for ongoing eDM campaigns;
* Allow a content editor without formal technical or design skills to create and deploy attractive looking emails quickly;
* Retain its rendering integrity every time it is cloned and re-used with fresh content, without having to be re-tested in the various email clients / browsers;
* Minimise future production and technical development costs.

Additionally, a Taguchi template can be further developed to become a sophisticated application that not only formats design elements but also implements a series of custom business rules.

These rules can control elements such as:

* Dynamic multi-variate testing (MVT);
* Customer segmentation logic;
* Personalisation and customisation;
* System integration;
* Custom presentation;
* Subscriber content preference logic;
* Subscriber clustering input;
* Custom tracking and conversion logic;
* Smartphone display formatting;
* Personalised ‘click here to view’ pages;
* Email client rendering rules;
* Multiple brand control elements and creative themes.

## Taguchi SMART Template

A Taguchi template can often involve a significant degree of programming logic depending on the level of custom requirement specified. Not only can this be quite costly to scope and develop but also many developers new to Taguchi don’t know where to start in order to get their clients up and running as quickly as possible.

Our Taguchi SMART Template is designed to assist this process by providing the necessary base code for a comprehensive and flexible template that incorporates an array of modules known as ‘content blocks’ that can be themed to provide a variety of attractive and functional email designs.

The SMART Template can be customised and configured for any broadcast, trigger or transactional email sent from Taguchi.

The standard content blocks included in the Taguchi SMART Template allow you to easily create newsletters, product catalogues, competition promotions, email blasts and so on.

Each content block (apart from the Intro Article) allows you to specify a width so that it can be placed within a ‘grid’. The available widths are full-width, half-width, third-width and quarter-width of the main internal content width.

The included content blocks are:

* Intro Article;
* Article;
* Banner;
* Product;
* Vertical Space;
* Raw HTML.
